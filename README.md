# React Dice Game

This application was created as an assignment for The Modern React Bootcamp by Colt Steele.

This application provided a few challenges that invlolved using state in a parent compent to pass as props to a child component.
In addition to handeling state for various tasks, CSS animations where included for each roll of the DIE as well as rendering the
roll button inactive during a roll. This was made possible by using the setTimeOut function and along with keeping track of whether
rolling was actively occuring or not.
